    """A Control class for responsive elements, including touch response functions.

    **IMPORTANT**: The *touch_point* for all functions should be in local coordinates
      for this item. That means, any widget should adjust the touchpoint for self.x and
      self.y before passing the touchpoint to this set of Control functions.

    The Control class uses a state variable **touch_boundary** [x, y, width, height]
    that defines the rectangular boundary for touch inputs.  The **touch_boundary**
    is used by the `contains` function to check when touches are within the Control's
    boundary.  Note: These **touch_boundary** dimensions are in the Control's local
    pixel coordinates.  The **x** and **y** values define the upper left corner of the
    **touch_boundary**.  The **touch_boundary** value should be updated by the sublcass
    definiton.
