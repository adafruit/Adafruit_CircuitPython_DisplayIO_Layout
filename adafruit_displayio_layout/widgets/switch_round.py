    **Quickstart: Importing and using SwitchRound**

        Here is one way of importing the `SwitchRound` class so you can use it as
        the name ``Switch``:

        .. code-block:: python

            from adafruit_displayio_layout.widgets.switch_round import SwitchRound as Switch

        Now you can create a switch at pixel position x=20, y=30 using:

        .. code-block:: python

            my_switch=Switch(20, 30) # instance the switch at x=20, y=30

        Once you setup your display, you can now add ``my_switch`` to your display using:

        .. code-block:: python

            display.root_group = my_switch # add the group to the display

        If you want to have multiple display elements, you can create a group and then
        append the switch and the other elements to the group.  Then, you can add the full
        group to the display as in this example:

        .. code-block:: python

            my_switch = Switch(20, 30) # instance the switch at x=20, y=30
            my_group = displayio.Group() # make a group
            my_group.append(my_switch) # Add my_switch to the group

            #
            # Append other display elements to the group
            #

            display.root_group = my_group # add the group to the display

        For a full example, including how to respond to screen touches, check out the
        following examples in the `Adafruit_CircuitPython_DisplayIO_Layout
        <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DisplayIO_Layout>`_ library:

        - ``examples/displayio_layout_switch_simpletest.py`` and
        - ``examples/displayio_layout_switch_multiple.py``


    .. _feature_summary:

    **Summary: SwitchRound Features and input variables**

    The `SwitchRound` widget has numerous options for controlling its position, visible appearance,
    orientation, animation speed and value through a collection of input variables:

        - **position**: ``x``, ``y`` or ``anchor_point`` and ``anchored_position``


        - **size**: ``width`` and ``height`` (recommend to leave ``width`` = None to use
          preferred aspect ratio)

        - **orientation and movement direction (on vs. off)**: ``horizontal`` and ``flip``

        - **switch color**: ``fill_color_off``, ``fill_color_on``, ``outline_color_off`` and
          ``outline_color_on``

        - **background color**: ``background_color_off``, ``background_color_on``,
          ``background_outline_color_off``, and ``background_outline_color_on``

        - **linewidths**: ``switch_stroke`` and ``text_stroke``

        - **0/1 display**: Set ``display_button_text`` = True if you want the 0/1 shapes
          to show on the switch

        - **animation**: Set ``animation_time`` to the duration (in seconds) it will take
          to transition the switch, set zero if you want it to snap into position immediately
          (0.2 seconds is a good starting point, and larger values for bigger switches)

        - **value**: Set ``value`` to the initial value (True or False)

        - **touch boundaries**: ``touch_padding`` defines the number of additional pixels
          surrounding the switch that should respond to a touch.  (Note: The ``touch_padding``
          variable updates the ``touch_boundary`` Control class variable.  The definition of
          the ``touch_boundary`` is used to determine the region on the Widget that returns
          `True` in the `contains` function.)

    .. _features:

    **Description of features**

        The `SwitchRound` widget is a sliding switch that changes state whenever it is
        touched.  The color gradually changes from the off-state color scheme to the
        on-state color scheme as the switch transfers from off to the on position.
        The switch has an optional display of "0" and "1" on the sliding switch.  The
        switch can be oriented using the ``horizontal`` input variable, and the sliding
        direction can be changed using the ``flip`` input variable.

        Regarding switch sizing, it is recommended to set the height dimension but to
        leave the ``width = None``.  Setting ``width = None`` will allow the width to resize
        to maintain a recommended aspect ratio of width/height.  Alternately, the switch
        can be resized using the `resize` command, and it will adjust the width and height
        to the maximum size that will fit inside the requested width and height dimensions,
        while keeping the preferred aspect ratio.  To make the switch easier to be selected,
        additional padding around the switch can be defined using the ``touch_padding`` input
        variable to increase the touch-responsive area. The duration of
        animation between on/off can be set using the ``animation_time`` input variable.

    .. _internals:

    **Internal details: How the SwitchRound widget works**

    The `SwitchRound` widget is a graphical element that responds to touch elements
    to provide sliding switch on/off behavior.  Whenever touched, the switch toggles
    to its alternate value. The following sections describe the construction of the
    `SwitchRound` widget, in the hopes that it will serve as a first example of the key
    properties and responses for widgets.

    The `SwitchRound` widget inherits from two classes, it is a subclass of `Widget` (which
    itself is a subclass of `displayio.Group`) and a subclass of `Control`.  The `Widget`
    class helps define the positioning and sizing of the switch, while the `Control` class
    helps define the touch-response behavior.

    The following several sections describe the structure and inner workings of `SwitchRound`.

    .. _group_structure:

    **Group structure: Display elements that make up SwitchRound**

        The `Widget` class is a subclass of `displayio.Group`, thus we can append graphical
        elements to the Widget for displaying on the screen.  The switch consists of the
        following graphical elements:

        0. switch_roundrect: The switch background
        1. switch_circle: The switch button that slides back and forth
        2. Optional: text_0: The "0" circle shape on the switch button
        3. Optional: text_1: The "1" rectangle shape on the switch button

        The optional text items can be displayed or hidden using the ``display_button_text``
        input variable.

    .. _coordinates:

    **Coordinate systems and use of anchor_point and anchored_position**

        See the `Widget` class definition for clarification on the methods for positioning
        the switch, including the difference in the display coordinate system and the Widget's
        local coordinate system.

    .. _construction:

    **The Widget construction sequence**

        Here is the set of steps used to define this sliding switch widget.

        1. Initialize the stationary display items
        2. Initialize the moving display elements
        3. Store initial position of the moving display elements
        4. Define "keyframes" to determine the translation vector
        5. Define the ``_draw_position`` function between 0.0 to 1.0 (and slightly beyond)
        6. Select the motion "easing" function
        7. **Extra**. Go check out the ``_animate_switch`` method

        First, the stationary background rounded rectangle (RoundRect is created).  Second,
        the moving display elements are created, the circle for the switch, the circle for
        the text "0" and the rectangle for the text "1". Note that either the "0" or "1" is
        set as hidden, depending upon the switch value.  Third, we store away the
        initial position of the three moving elements, these initial values will be used in the
        functions that move these display elements.  Next, we define the motion of the
        moving element, by setting the ``self._x_motion`` and ``self._y_motion`` values
        that depending upon the ``horizontal`` and ``flip`` variables. These motion variables
        set the two "keyframes" for the moving elements, basically the endpoints of the switch
        motion.  (Note: other widgets may need an ``_angle_motion`` variable if they require
        some form of rotation.)  Next, we define the ``_draw_function`` method.  This method
        takes an input between 0.0 and 1.0 and adjusts the position relative to the motion
        variables, where 0.0 is the initial position and 1.0 represents the final position
        (as defined by the ``_x_motion`` and ``_y_motion`` values).  In the case of the
        sliding switch, we also use this ``position`` value (0.0 to 1.0) to gradually
        grade the color of the components between their "on" and "off" colors.

    .. _move:

    **Making it move**

        Everything above has set the ground rules for motion, but doesn't cause it to move.
        However, you have set almost all the pieces in place to respond to requests to change
        the position.  All that is left is the **Extra** method that performs the animation,
        called ``_animate_switch``. The ``_animate_switch`` method is triggered by a touch
        event through the ``selected`` Control class method.  Once triggered, this method
        checks how much time has elapsed.  Based on the elapsed time and the ``animation_time``
        input variable, the ``_animate_switch`` function calculates the ``position`` where
        the switch should be.  Then, it takes this ``position`` to call the ``_draw_position``
        method that will update the display elements based on the requested position.

        But there's even one more trick to the animation.  The ``_animate_switch`` calculates
        the target position based on a linear relationship between the time and the position.
        However, to give the animation a better "feel", it is desirable to tweak the motion
        function depending upon how this widget should behave or what suits your fancy. To
        do this we can use an "easing" function.  In short, this adjusts the constant speed
        (linear) movement to a variable speed during the movement.  Said another way, it
        changes the position versus time function according to a specific waveform equation.
        There are a lot of different "easing" functions that folks have used or you can make
        up your own.  Some common easing functions are provided in the ``easing.py`` file.
        You can change the easing function based on changing which function is imported
        at the top of this file. You can see where the position is tweaked by the easing
        function in the line in the ``_animate_switch`` method:

        .. code-block:: python

            self._draw_position(easing(position))  # update the switch position

        Go play around with the different easing functions and observe how the motion
        behavior changes.  You can use these functions in multiple dimensions to get all
        varieties of behavior that you can take advantage of.  The website
        `easings.net <https://easings.net>`_ can help you
        visualize some of the behavior of the easing functions.

    .. note:: Some of the "springy" easing functions require position values
            slightly below 0.0 and slightly above 1.0, so if you want to use these, be sure
            to check that your ``_draw_position`` method behaves itself for that range
            of position inputs.

    .. _orientation:

    **Orientation and a peculiarity of width and height definitions for SwitchRound**

        In setting the switch sizing, use height and width to set the narrow and wide
        dimension of the switch.  To try and reduce confusion, the orientation is modified
        after the height and width are selected.  That is, if the switch is set to vertical,
        the height and still mean the "narrow" and the width will still mean the dimensions
        in the direction of the sliding.

        If you need the switch to fit within a specific bounding box, it's preferred to use
        the ``resize`` function.  This will put the switch (in whatever orientation) at the
        maximum size where it can fit within the bounding box that you specified.  The switch
        aspect ratio will remain at the "preferred" aspect ratio of of 2:1 (width to height)
        after the resizing.

    .. _touch:

    **Setting the touch response boundary**

        The touch response area is defined by the Control class variable called
        ``touch_boundary``. In the case of the `SwitchRound` widget, we provide an
        ``touch_padding`` input variable.  The use of ``touch_padding`` defines an
        additional number of pixels surrounding the display elements that respond to touch
        events.  To achieve this additional space, the ``touch_boundary`` increases in size
        in all dimensions by the number of pixels specified in the ``touch_padding`` parameter.

        The ``touch_boundary`` is used in the Control function ``contains`` that checks
        whether any touch_points are within the boundary. Please pay particular attention to
        the `SwitchRound` contains function, since it calls the `Control.contains` superclass
        function with the touch_point value adjusted for the switch's ``.x`` and ``.y`` values.
        This offset adjustment is required since the `Control.contains` function operates only
        on the widget's local coordinate system.  It's good to keep in mind which coordinate
        system you are working in, to ensure your code responds to the right inputs!

    .. _summary:

    **Summary**

        The `SwitchRound` widget is an example to explain the use of the `Widget` and `Control`
        class functions.  The `Widget` class handles the overall sizing and positioning function
        and is the group that holds all the graphical elements.  The `Control` class is used to
        define the response of the widget to touch events (or could be generalized to other
        inputs).  Anything that only displays (such as a graph or an indicator light) won't
        need to inherit the `Control` class.  But anything that responds to touch inputs should
        inherit the `Control` class to define the ``touch_boundary`` and the touch response
        functions.

        I hope this `SwitchRound` widget will help turn on some new ideas and highlight some
        of the new capabilities of the `Widget` and `Control` classes.  Now go see what else
        you can create and extend from here!

    **A Final Word**

    The design of the Widget and Control classes are open for inputs.  If you think
    a additions or changes are useful, add it and please submit a pull request so
    others can use it too!  Also, keep in mind you don't even need to follow these classes
    to get the job done.  The Widget and Class definitions are designed to give guidance
    about one way to make things work, and to try to share some code.  If it's standing in
    your way, do something else!  If you want to use the ``grid_layout`` or other layout tools
    in this library, you only *really* need to have methods for positioning and resizing.

    .. note:: **Never let any of these class definitions hold you back, let your imagination run
        wild and make some cool widgets!**
