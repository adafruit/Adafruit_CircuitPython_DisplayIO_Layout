    **SwitchRound Features**

    The `SwitchRound` widget is a sliding switch that changes state whenever it is
    touched.  The color gradually changes from the off-state color scheme to the
    on-state color scheme as the switch transfers from off to the on position.
    The switch has an optional display of "0" and "1" on the sliding switch.  The
    switch can be oriented using the ``horizontal`` input variable, and the sliding
    direction can be changed using the ``flip`` input variable.  The duration of
    animation between on/off can be set using the ``animation_time`` input variable.
    Regarding switch sizing, it is recommended to set the height dimension but to
    leave the width as None.  Setting width to None will allow the width to resize
    to maintain a recommended aspect ration of width/height.  Alternately, the switch
    can be resized using the `resize` command, and it will adjust the width and height
    to the maximum size that will fit inside the requested width and height dimensions,
    while keeping the preferred aspect ratio.  To make the switch easier to be selected,
    additional padding around the switch can be defined using the ``touch_padding`` input
    variable to increase the touch-responsive area.

    The following sections provide details on the construction of the switch
    as an introductory guide to using the `Widget` and `Control` classes for create
    touch-responsive graphical user interface widgets.

    **Details of the SwitchRound widget**

    The `SwitchRound` widget is a graphical element that responds to touch elements
    to provide sliding switch on/off behavior.  Whenever touched, the switch toggles
    to its alternate value. The following sections describe the construction of the
    `SwitchRound` widget, in the hopes that it will serve as a first example of the key
    properties and responses for widgets.

    The `SwitchRound` widget inherits from two classes, it is a subclass of Group->Widget
    and a subclass of Control.  The `Widget` class helps define the positioning and
    sizing of the switch, while the `Control` class defines the touch-response behavior.

    **Group structure: Display elements that make up SwitchRound**

    The Widget is a subclass of ``displayio.Group``, thus we can append graphical
    elements to the Widget for displaying on the screen.  The switch consists of the
    following graphical elements:

    0. switch_roundrect: The switch background
    1. switch_circle: The switch button that slides back and forth
    2. Optional: text_0: The "0" circle shape on the switch button
    3. Optional: text_1: The "1" rectangle shape on the switch button

    The optional text items can be displayed or hidden using the ``display_button_text``
    input variable.

    **Coordinate systems and use of anchor_point and anchored_position**

    See the `Widget` class definition for clarification on the methods for positioning
    the switch, including the difference in the display coordinate system and the Widget's
    local coordinate system.

    **The Widget construction sequence**

    Here is the set of steps that are used to define this switch widget.

    1. Initialize the stationary items
    2. Initialize the moving display elements
    3. Store initial position of the moving display elements
    4. Define "keyframes" to determine the translation vector
    5. Define the ``_draw_position`` function between 0.0 to 1.0 (and slightly beyond)
    6. Select the motion "easing" function
    7. **Extra**. Go check out the ``_animate_switch`` method

    First, the stationary background rounded rectangle (RoundRect is created).  Second,
    the moving display elements are created, the circle for the switch, the circle for
    the text "0" and the rectangle for the text "1". Note that either the "0" or "1" is
    set as hidden, depending upon the switch value.  Third, we store away the
    initial position of the three moving elements, these initial values will be used in the
    functions that move these display elements.  Next, we define the motion of the
    moving element, by setting the ``self._x_motion`` and ``self._y_motion`` values
    that depending upon the ``horizontal`` and ``flip`` variables. These motion variables
    set the two "keyframes" for the moving elements, basically the endpoints of the switch
    motion.  (Note: other widgets may need an ``_angle_motion`` variable if they require
    some form of rotation.)  Next, we define the ``_draw_function`` method.  This method
    takes an input between 0.0 and 1.0 and adjusts the position relative to the motion
    variables, where 0.0 is the initial position and 1.0 represents the final position
    (as defined by the ``_x_motion`` and ``_y_motion`` values).  In the case of the
    sliding switch, we also use this ``position`` value (0.0 to 1.0) to gradually
    grade the color of the components between their "on" and "off" colors.

    **Making it move**

    Everything above has set the ground rules for motion, but doesn't cause it to move.
    However, you have set almost all the pieces in place to respond to requests to change
    the position.  All that is left is the **Extra** method that performs the animation,
    called ``_animate_switch``. The ``animate_switch`` method is triggered by a touch
    event through the ``selected`` Control class method.  Once triggered, this method
    checks how much time has elapsed.  Based on the elapsed time and the ``animation_time``
    input variable, the ``animate_switch`` function calculates the ``position`` where
    the switch should be.  Then, it takes this ``position`` to call the ``_draw_position``
    method that will update the display elements based on the requested position.

    But there's even one more trick to the animation.  The ``animate_switch`` calculates
    the target position based on a linear relationship between the time and the position.
    However, to give the animation a better "feel", it is desirable to tweak the motion
    function depending upon how this widget should behave or what suits your fancy. To
    do this we can use an "easing" function.  In short, this adjusts the constant speed
    (linear) movement to a variable speed during the movement.  Said another way, it
    changes the position versus time function according to a specific waveform equation.
    There are a lot of different "easing" functions that folks have used or you can make
    up your own.  Some common easing functions are provided in the ``easing.py`` file.
    You can change the easing function based on changing which function is imported
    at the top of this file. You can see where the position is tweaked by the easing
    function in the line in the ``_animate_switch`` method:

        .. code-block::python

        self._draw_position(easing(position))  # update the switch position

    Go play around with the different easing functions and observe how the motion
    behavior changes.  You can use these functions in multiple dimensions to get all
    varieties of behavior that you can take advantage of.  Here's a good website
    that lets you visualize some of the behavior of the easing functions:
    <https://easings.net>.  Note: Some of the "springy" easing functions have values
    slightly below 0.0 and slightly above 1.0, so if you want to use these, be sure
    to check that your ``_draw_position`` method behaves itself for that larger range
    of position inputs.

    **Orientation and a peculiarity of width and height definitions for SwitchRound**

    In setting the switch sizing, use height and width to set the narrow and wide
    dimension of the switch.  To try and reduce confusion, the orientation is modified
    after the height and width are selected.  That is, if the switch is set to vertical,
    the height and still mean the "narrow" and the width will still mean the dimensions
    in the direction of the sliding.

    If you need the switch to fit within a specific bounding box, it's preferred to use
    the ``resize`` function.  This will put the switch (in whatever orientation) at the
    maximum size where it can fit within the bounding box that you specified.  The switch
    aspect ratio will remain at the "preferred" aspect ratio of of 2:1 (width to height)
    after the resizing.

    **Setting the touch response boundary**

    The touch response area is defined by the Control class variable called
    ``touch_boundary``. In the case of the `SwitchRound` widget, we provide an
    ``touch_padding`` input variable.  The use of ``touch_padding`` defines an
    additional number of pixels surrounding the display elements that respond to touch
    events.  To achieve this additional space, the ``touch_boundary`` increases in size
    in all dimensions by the number of pixels specified in the ``touch_padding`` parameter.

    The ``touch_boundary`` is used in the Control function ``contains`` that checks
    whether any touch_points are within the boundary. Please pay particular attention to
    the `SwitchRound` contains function, since it calls the `Control.contains` superclass
    function with the touch_point value adjusted for the switch's ``.x`` and ``.y`` values.
    This offset adjustment is required since the `Control.contains` function operates only
    on the widget's local coordinate system.  It's good to keep in mind which coordinate
    system you are working in, so you'll write your code to respond to the right inputs!

    **Summary**

    The `SwitchRound` widget is an example to explain the use of the `Widget` and `Control`
    class functions.  The `Widget` class handles the overall sizing and positioning function
    and is the group that holds all the graphical elements.  The `Control` class is used to
    define the response of the widget to touch events (or could be generalized to other
    inputs).  Anything that only displays (such as a graph or an indicator light) won't
    need to inherit the `Control` class.  But anything that responds to touch inputs should
    inherit the `Control` class to define the ``touch_boundary`` and the touch response
    functions.

    I hope this `SwitchRound` widget will help turn on some new ideas and highlight some
    of the new capabilities of the `Widget` and `Control` classes.  Now go see what else
    you can create and extend from here!

    **A Final Word**

    The design of the Widget and Control classes are open for inputs.  If you think
    an addition or change will be useful, add it and please submit a pull request so
    other can use it too!  Also, keep in mind you don't even need to follow these classes
    to get the job done.  The Widget and Class definitions are designed to give guidance
    about one way to make things work, and try to share some code.  If it's standing in
    your way, do something else!  If you want to use the ``grid_layout`` or other layout tools
    in this library, you only *really* need to have methods for positioning and resizing.
    **Don't let any of these class definitions hold you back, let your imagination run
    wild and make some cool widgets!**
